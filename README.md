# MediCal

This app was created to manage hospital's patien's informations

## Development

When starting the application `docker compose up` is called and the app will connect to the contained services.
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) must be available on the current system.

Please make sure the assgined database port in docker matches the one specified in the ressources/application.yml

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options". Create your own
`application-local.yml` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -

In addition to the Spring Boot application, the development server must also be started - for this
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 is required. Angular CLI and required dependencies must be installed once:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```

The development server can be started as follows:

```
ng serve
```

Your application is now accessible under `localhost:4200`.

Add code using Angular schematics with `ng generate ...`.
Generate a messages.json for translation with `ng extract-i18n –format=json`.

## Testing requirements

Testcontainers is used for running the integration tests. Due
to the reuse flag, the container will not shut down after the tests. It can be stopped manually if needed.

Frontend unit tests can be executed with `ng test`.

## Build

The application can be tested and built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Start the application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/medi-cal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as
environment variable when running the container.

```
mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=com.b3al.med/medi-cal
```
